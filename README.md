# Ineuron-Internship-project -Heart-Disease-Prediction-Analysis
### Objective 🎯
- The goal of this project is to analyse the heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features that describes the heart disease.

### Poblem Statement ❓
- Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid 19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyse this health and medical data for better future preparation.

# Conclusion:

HEART DISEASE
- The Given Dataset of Heart Disease contains data of 303 people among them 164 are males and 139 are females,
- Mostly males are sufdering from heart Disease 114 males, and female suffering from Heart Disease are 25
- People suffering from heart disease are mostly in age group of 55-65 years.

CHEST PAIN
- People who HAVE HEART DISEASE mostly are suffering from non-anginal pain 68 people,People who DON'T HAVE HEART DISEASE mostly are suffering from asymptomatic pain 105 people, 
- More Male are Suffering from chest pain as compared to females and mostly MALES Female both have SYMPTOMATIC type of chest pain 
- ELDERLY AGE People are suffering from CHEST PAIN as comapre to MIDDLE AGE and YOUNG AGE, mostly ELDERLY AGE and MIDDLE AGE People are suffering from ASYPTOMATIC type of CHEST PAIN, mand YONG AGE are suffering from NON ANGINAL CHEST PAIN

THALISSIMAIA- People having no thalassaemia can also suffer from heart disease, but patients having reversable effect thalassaemia have greater chances of suffering from heart disease. So thalassaemia plays an important role in detecting heart disease.
- Mostly people who have heart Disease are suffering from REVERSABLE DEFECT of THALISSIMA and mostly peole who dont have heart disease are suffering from NORMAL THALISSIMA
- Mostly MALE are suffering from  REVERSABLE DEFECT  of THALISSIMA and mostly FEMALE are suffering from NORMAL THALISSIMA   

CHOLESTROL LEVEL-Higher cholesterol means higher chances of heart disease. it plays an important role in determining heart problems. With age cholesterol increases and level 200- 350 mg/dl are of concern.
- Cholestrol Increasing at the age group of 50-68
- People in the age of around 53 to 68 have higher Cholestrol level
- Mostly MALES's CHOLESTROL LEVEL is high as copared to males.
- People who have HIGH CHOLESTROL LEVEL are suffering from HEART DISEASE
- ELDERLY AGE people have HIGH CHOLESTROL LEVEL as compared to MIDDLE AGE and YOUNG AGE people

FASTING BLOOD SUGAR
- People who have High blood sugar there are more Chances have Heart Disease
- people with age >55 years and having resting blood suger( i.e in diastolic state) in range 121-140 mm Hg have higher chances of heart disease.
- people with age group 40 to 45 have little chances and age below 40 has negligiable cances of having a heart disease.

RESTEC
- restecg {resting EKG results}: People with a value of 1 (reporting an abnormal heart rhythm, which can range from mild symptoms to severe problems) are more likely to have heart disease
- people showing definite left ventricular hypertrophy in Resting electrocardiographic measurement are more likely to suffer from a heart disease.

EXANG
- exang {exercise-induced angina}: People with a value of 0 (No — angina induced by exercise) have more heart disease than people with a value of 1 (Yes — angina induced by exercise)
- If people suffer from Angina,must be concerned that exercise will make your symptoms worse.
- Males have have high Exercise Angina(A type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart)

BLOOD PRESSURE
- BLOOD PRESSURE started INCREASING at the age group of 50-68
- People in the age of around 55 to 70 have HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
- People who have HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE are suffering from not HEART DISEASE
- Mostly MALES's BLOOD PRESSURE is high as copared to males.
- People who have HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE are suffering from ASYPTOMATIC CHEST PAIN

HEART RATE
- The HEART RATE started decreasing at the age 50 onwords
- With age cholestrol level and BP increases and Heart Rate decreases.
- People who are likely to suffer from heart disease have higher maximum heart rates( rate between 140-160) whereas patients who are not likely to suffer from heart disease are having lower maximum heart rates.

OLDPEAK
- More Males are prone to ST depression as compare to females.
- St_depression >0.5 mm in ECG indicates abnormality. Therefore the slope of the peak exercise ST segment showing downslope with st_depression>0.5 mm has greater chances of heart disease.
- we can observe from here that ST depression mostly increases bw the age group of 30-40
- ST depression refers to a finding on an electrocardiogram, wherein the trace in the ST segment is abnormally low below the baseline.


SLOPE {the slope of the ST segment of peak exercise}: 
- People with a slope value of 2 (Downsloping: signs of an unhealthy heart) are more likely to have heart disease than people with a slope value of 2 slope is 0 (Upsloping: best heart rate with exercise) or 1 (Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)).

CA {number of major vessels (0–3) stained by fluoroscopy}:
- The more blood movement the better, so people with ca equal to 0 are more likely to have heart disease.
